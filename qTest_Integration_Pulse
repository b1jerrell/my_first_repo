## Sample Workflows

These are sample workflows that can be imported into Pulse using the Import Rules wizard.

### scenario-cucumber.json: Scenario + Cucumber

This workflow replicates the workflow published in the original [Pulse v9.1 repository](https://github.com/QASymphony/PulseRules_v9.1).  It requires the use of the Scenario Plugin for Jira, any repository, Jenkins, and Cucumber for Java  4.0+.
